	abstract = {Sintering is a process that involves complex physical and chemical reactions. An intelligent coordinating control strategy is proposed for the strong coupling between the burn-through point (BTP) and the mixture bunker level (MBL). First, an intelligent integrated controller is established for the BTP by fusing the neural network, expert rules, and fuzzy logic. Moreover, an expert controller is designed for the MBL based on expert rules using the analysis of the main factors that affect the MBL. Furthermore, by employing the soft switching control algorithm, an intelligent coordinating controller for the BTP and the MBL is designed. The optimal operation parameters are obtained from the algorithm, which realize the multi-objective control of the sintering process. Finally, a simulation and an experiment of the intelligent coordinating control between the BTP and the MBL are carried out, where the models of the BTP and the MBL are the Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model and the linear model, respectively. And the results show that the proposed approach is feasible and effective.},

This process features strong nonlinearity and time-varying parameters. First, experiments were carried out to establish a model of the gas temperature distribution (GTD) in the sintering machine; and based on the GTD model, a surface temperature model of the material (STMM) was established. Second, based on the STMM, a method of estimating the BTP that uses a soft-sensing technique was devised. In order to improve the estimation precision, a time-sequence-based model for predicting the BTP was built using grey system theory. Since the BTP is also affected by process parameters, a technological-parameter-based model for predicting the BTP was then built using a neural network. Finally, an integrated model for predicting the BTP was constructed by combining the time-sequence-based and the technological-parameter-based models using a fuzzy classifier. The result of actual runs shows that, compared to the manual control, the integrated prediction model reduced the variation in BTP by about 50.

Due to an opening combustion and multiple input conditions, the combustion process of the sintering process shows a typical characteristic of time-varying operation conditions. This paper analyzes the influence factors resulting in time-varying operation conditions and then constructs an improved Takagi-Sugeno (T-S) fuzzy model of BTP based on the linear parameter varying (LPV-TS-BTP model), in which the BTP temperature and the central bellows temperature are taken as time-varying parameters. The model explains how the different working conditions change the systems dynamics and describes this time-varying nonlinear model in the form of a linear combination model. Then, a fuzzy robust control method based on the LPV-TS-BTP model is designed by using the parallel distributed compensation principle to realize the BTP control of complex process, in which the controller parameters are achieved by using the linear matrix inequality (LMI) method. The simulations about modeling and control, which are carried out on a semiphysical simulation platform for the sintering process, verify that the model has a high prediction accuracy, and the fuzzy robust control makes BTP stable around a given bellows.},

Finally, the relationship between heat transfer and friction factor is examined by grey relational analysis. As a result, it is shown that most strength parameter on average Nusselt number is the Reynolds number. Then the width, pitch and thickness of the corrugated tapes can be ordered according to their effects' levels. However, the thickness is the most effective factor of the friction factor. Then the width and Reynolds number comes in order. The pitch has found to have negligible effect on friction factor.},

	abstract = {The grey dynamic model by convolution integral with the first-order derivative of the 1-AGO data and n series related, abbreviated as GDMC (1, n), performs well in modelling and forecasting of a grey system. To improve the modelling accuracy of GDMC (1, n), n interpolation coefficients (taken as unknown parameters) are introduced into the background values of the n variables. The parameters optimization is formulated as a combinatorial optimization problem and is solved collectively using the particle swarm optimization algorithm. The optimized result has been verified by a case study of the economic output of high-tech industry in China. Comparisons of the obtained modelling results from the optimized GDMC (1, n) model with the traditional one demonstrate that the optimal algorithm is a good alternative for parameters optimization of the GDMC (1, n) model. The modelling results can assist the government in developing future policies regarding high-tech industry management. {\textcopyright} 2014 Zheng-Xin Wang and Ling-Ling Pei.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a dynamic modeling method for predicting the exhaust-gas temperature (EGT) of the burn-through point (BTP) in an iron sintering process. First, a subspace modeling method is used to build a steady-state subspace model (SSSM) for the EGT at a steady state. Then, a dynamic subspace model (DSM) that is driven by the errors of the SSSMs is developed to improve the accuracy of the EGT prediction in a continuous process. Finally, a grid search dynamic subspace model (GSDSM) is established to find the best parameters for each SSSM in the DSM. Verification results show that the GSDSM yields a predicted EGT with a high precision, which can be implemented in a predicting controller an actual sintering process.},
